## Project's aim
Our aim for MOI-ME-RIES was to have a user generated profile of their passions, hobbies and life goals. Our focus for the first iteration was to focus on the bucket-list aspect of the project. The bucket list, or bucket, is a place for users to add things they would like to accomplish in life. As the user meets those goals they can cross them off the list and add a commemorative photo and journal entry. 




## How to use
Upon navigating to the site new users will be presented with an introductory page where they will see the mission statement of the application along with a login button. (If the user is a returning user is still signed in they will skip this step) The log in will take them to a page with inputs for email and a password as well as a sign up button to click if they are a new user. Once the user is signed up they will be directed to their bucket page. If they are returning users they will see several highlights of previously completed bucket list items. There is an input for users to start adding items to their bucket list. Once an item has been added its title will appear on the left hand column. The user can click on that title to 'check off' that item. Once they click on the button they will be prompted with a menu where they can upload an image and write a blurb relating to the completion of this bucket list item.  Once submitted the title will be moved from the bucket list to the completed bucket list with a strike through the text. If clicked the stricken items will bring up all the details of associated with that bucket list item.

## Possible future add ons
* Add subcategories to the bucket section so users can create a more detail plan or itinerary to meet that goal. It will mimic the action of the main item; as the user meets a goal or sub section of a goal they can check it off the list and add photos, journal entries and , in another add on, add links to websites associated with that list item, create playlists and drop pins on a map. 
* Create a template for the users to assemble pages dedicated to their hobbies and passions. Our goal is to provide the user with the ability to put together a collection of resources or projects or photos related to their specific interests.
* We are also planning on building the a way for users to share their pages and explore other pages. Part of that functionality would be the ability to recreate another users bucket-list item in their own bucket with one click.
* Another part of the interactivity would be writing 'letters' to other users. They would be private and mocked up to look like pen and paper letters. The goal is to encourage the user to treat it as a substantive way to keep in touch with others. 
* Rework the photo storage system to make it it scalable. More than likely a third party storage service.
